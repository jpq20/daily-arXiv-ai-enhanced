However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.\n  To address this, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.\n  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \\textbf{5.7$\\times$} retrieval speedup and \\textbf{1.8$\\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \\textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems.

While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360\u00b0. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models.

The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis.

We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists.

Traditional approaches include writing custom GPU kernels and using specialized model compilers to tune high-level code for specific GPU targets. Recent work shows that LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively perform such tuning, often outperforming existing compilers and eliminating the need for manual kernel development. However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps. The best implementation achieves an average 2.88x speedup on an H100 GPU across diverse tasks in KernelBench, a benchmark suite covering a range of machine learning architectures in PyTorch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53PyTorch\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5229\u7528\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u5728H100 GPU\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f972.88\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53ef\u7528GPU\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u7f16\u5199\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49GPU\u5185\u6838\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9aGPU\u76ee\u6807\u8c03\u4f18\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u8fd1\u5de5\u4f5c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6267\u884c\u6b64\u7c7b\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53PyTorch\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5229\u7528\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u5bf9\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728KernelBench\u57fa\u51c6\u5957\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u5728H100 GPU\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f972.88\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728PyTorch\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5229\u7528\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEliDecide\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u692d\u5706\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5f00\u653e\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7403\u5f62\u8fb9\u754c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5df2\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u5448\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u7403\u5f62\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u83b7\u5f97\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u77e9\u9635\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u692d\u5706\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u7a7a\u95f4\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u610f\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u692d\u5706\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u610f\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EliDecide\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u692d\u5706\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.\n  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories.

In the representative scenario of smart farming, planning efficient harvesting schedules for a fleet of electric robots presents a highly challenging frontier problem. The complexity arises not only from the need to find Pareto-optimal solutions for the conflicting objectives of makespan and transportation cost, but also from the necessity to simultaneously manage payload constraints and finite battery capacity. When robot loads are dynamically updated during planned multi-trip operations, a mandatory recharge triggered by energy constraints introduces an unscheduled load reset. This interaction creates a complex cascading effect that disrupts the entire schedule and renders traditional optimization methods ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm (SABA). The core of SABA lies in the organic combination of two synergistic mechanisms: the sequential anchoring and balancing mechanism, which leverages charging decisions as `anchors' to systematically reconstruct disrupted routes, while the proportional splitting-based rebalancing mechanism is responsible for the fine-grained balancing and tuning of the final solutions' makespans. Extensive comparative experiments, conducted on a real-world case study and a suite of benchmark instances, demonstrate that SABA comprehensively outperforms 6 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution convergence and diversity.

Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic.

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era.

Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u5c5e\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u5178\u96c6\u548c\u8bcd-\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u8bcd\u5178\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u63a2\u7d22\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u5f52\u56e0\u5e38\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6deb\u79fd\u3001\u5a01\u80c1\u3001\u4fae\u8fb1\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u6027\u66b4\u9732\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u6307\u6807\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u68af\u5ea6(CG)\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b3. \u6784\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u5178\u96c6\u6355\u83b7\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u8bcd\u6c47\uff1b4. \u8ba1\u7b97\u8bcd-\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50(WCA)\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u5316\u8bcd\u6c47\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6bd2\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b5. \u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u8bcd\u5178\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6392\u9664\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6bd2\u6027\u8bcd\u5178\u96c6\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u56e0\u679c\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6bd2\u6027\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u8bcd\u5178\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u8bcd\u5178\u96c6\u548cWCA\u8bc4\u5206\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u65e0\u8bcd\u5178\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd2\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eHDR\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u534f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "HDR\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u534f\u540c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees.

However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance.

Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashCache\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f02\u5e38KV\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u504f\u79bb\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5f02\u5e38KV\u5bf9\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u968f\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u957f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u4eceKV\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u5e03\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u9891\u57df\u4e3b\u80fd\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u504f\u79bb\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5f02\u5e38KV\u5bf9\uff1b3\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u6bcf\u5c42KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u591a\u5f02\u5e38KV\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cFlashCache\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe1.69\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f\u548c80%\u7684KV\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashCache\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f02\u5e38KV\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones. Due to infrastructure limitations, we introduce a memory-efficient retrieval implementation that loads only required line offsets rather than entire files, reducing RAM requirements from over 128 GB per server to 32 GB. We also extend the original study by evaluating R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B, showing that test-time training yields consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures.

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MirrorMind\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u53cc\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3AI\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2a\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u79d1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u4e3a\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6027\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u6784\u5efa\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u5c42\u9762\u6620\u5c04\u96c6\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3a\u5b66\u79d1\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\uff0c\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5c42\u9762\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7f16\u6392\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f5c\u8005\u7ea7\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u4e92\u8865\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u534f\u4f5c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aMirrorMind\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u96c6\u4f53\u5b66\u79d1\u5e7f\u5ea6\uff0cMirrorMind\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation.

We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\\%, revealing a 4.21$\\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus.

For these agents, scaling involves not only \"thinking\" in tokens but also \"acting\" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack \"budget awareness\" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to \"dig deeper\" on a promising lead or \"pivot\" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier.

Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity. In this study, We classify large-scale IoT attacks by utilizing the CICIoT2023 dataset. Through meticulous analysis and experimentation, our objective is to illuminate the performance nuances of these FL methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08FedAvg\u3001FedProx\u3001Scaffold\uff09\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CICIoT2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u6fc0\u589e\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u66b4\u6da8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CICIoT2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8f83FedAvg\u3001FedProx\u548cScaffold\u4e09\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on.

In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods.

However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \\textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice.

Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).\n  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model.

The architecture integrates three key innovations: a Riemannian VAE for manifold embedding that preserves geometric structure, a geometric Transformer with geodesic-aware attention mechanisms operating directly on neural manifolds, and a dynamics predictor leveraging neural ODEs for manifold-constrained temporal evolution. Extensive evaluation across four public datasets demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 4.6-4.8% higher accuracy and 6.2-10.2% higher Cohen's Kappa, while maintaining robust cross-subject generalization.

The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers.

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u5206\u7c7b\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u6570\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8981\u6c42\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e8f\u6570\u5171\u5f62\u5206\u7c7b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u5c0f\u957f\u5ea6\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u6765\u7f29\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1115%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

It has long been argued that verbs describing an agentive action are more likely to appear in an unergative syntax, and those describing a telic event to appear in an unaccusative syntax.

Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales.

Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c42\u6b21\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5236(HTAM)\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df(\u5982\u9065\u611f\u5206\u6790)\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6(\u5982ReAct\u6216\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5)\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9065\u611f\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\u673a\u5236(HTAM)\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u3002\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\u786e\u4fdd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u4e00\u5c42\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eHTAM\u6846\u67b6\u7684EarthAgent\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u56fa\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5065\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

This study focuses on Homarus gammarus (European lobster), a key species for fisheries and aquaculture, and leverages non-invasive Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM). Understanding lobster habitats, welfare, reproduction, sex, and age is crucial for management and conservation. While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female).\n  The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features.\n  For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%).

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5bf9LLM\u63a2\u6d4b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5230\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6210\u529f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6216\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u7684LLM\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cdLLM\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5230\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5230\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6210\u529f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u63a7\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u540c\u9886\u57df\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406LLM\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSoft Concept Mixing (SCM)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8f6f\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u6765\u7f29\u5c0fLLMs\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8f6f\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46LLMs\u662f\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCM\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8f6f\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\uff08\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6982\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6df7\u5408\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6574\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCM\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "SCM\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u8f6f\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm.

With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\u611f\u77e5\u5b9a\u91cf\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8bba\u70b9\u7684\u58f0\u660e-\u7406\u7531\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ARQUSUMM\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528LLM\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc6\u522b\u53e5\u5b50\u5185\u7684\u547d\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8bba\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u805a\u5408\u8bba\u70b9\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u652f\u6301\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u8bdd\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u4ec5\u603b\u7ed3\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7406\u7531\u548c\u8bba\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u7136\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u53e5\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u6df1\u5165\u63ed\u793a\u53e5\u5b50\u5185\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ARQUSUMM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bba\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7684LLM\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc6\u522b\u53e5\u5b50\u5185\u7684\u547d\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u58f0\u660e-\u7406\u7531\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u8bba\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u805a\u5408\u8bba\u70b9\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u652f\u6301\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eARQUSUMM\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6458\u8981\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u793a\u8bba\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bba\u70b9\u611f\u77e5\u5b9a\u91cf\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ARQUSUMM\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints.

Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations.

Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment. Among intervention strategies, simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal or negative effects, whereas concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores.

While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework across various evaluation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "CroTad\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u9608\u503c\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u70b9\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9608\u503c\u8c03\u4f18\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6b63\u5e38\u51fa\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CroTad\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9608\u503c\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6AnalyticScore\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u539f\u5219\uff08FGTI\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1AnalyticScore\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u54cd\u5e94\u5143\u7d20\uff1b2)\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u5c06\u54cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff1b3)\u5e94\u7528\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "AnalyticScore\u5728ASAP-SAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768410\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bc4\u5206\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91caSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u76f8\u5dee0.06 QWK\uff1b\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FGTI\u539f\u5219\u548cAnalyticScore\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life.

Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\\%, and up to 9\\% in certain cases.

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6574\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u9002\u914dLLM\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u6574\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\u7684LLM2Comp\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIRM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u6b67\u6f02\u79fb\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e14\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76f4\u63a5\u7f13\u89e3\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u6b67\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u4f20\u8f93\u5355\u7ec4\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u7a33\u5b9a\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5206\u6b67\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u6743\u8861\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "FIRM\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u6ed1\u8c03\u6574\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation.

Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6f14\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08EMTC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u53d8\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u5185\u751f\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u6001\u673a\u5668\u8fd0\u884c\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u53d1\u7535\u96f6\u8f93\u51fa\u671f\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5197\u4f59\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5224\u522b\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEMTC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u53d8\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a9\u7801\uff08IVM\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5185\u751f\u89c6\u56fe\uff08MEV\uff09\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u3002IVM\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u8868\u793a\uff0cMEV\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEMTC\u4f18\u4e8e8\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53474.85%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EMTC\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08FLOPs\uff09\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bGPU\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbKaplan\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u53bb\u566a\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u6267\u884c\u800c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u80fd\u8017\u3002\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u79cdGPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u8017\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08R\u5e73\u65b9>0.9\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u79e9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eedAI\u90e8\u7f72\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u4f30\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as \"I don't know\", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u6790LLM\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5f03\u6743\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u751f\u6210\u540e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u524d\u9632\u6b62\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "ABCA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790LLM\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5b66\u79d1\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\uff09\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cABCA\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f03\u6743\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5f03\u6743\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ABCA\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5f03\u6743\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86LLM\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408(AGFF)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8bcd\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u95fb\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408(AGFF)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u660e\u667a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cAGFF\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u578b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u5229\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u65b0\u95fb\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, hash collisions cause distinct substructures to be represented with the same feature, leading to overestimates in molecular similarity calculations.

Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (\"retain-invariant\"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects.

Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps.

This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low \"follow rates\" ($\\leq 11\\%$, GPT-5: 4\\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient.

Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages.

We detail the translation and adaptation process carried out by translation specialists and evaluate the performance of both proprietary and open source models on the human translated benchmark. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of achieving high-quality machine translation by incorporating insights from the manual translation process into the design of a detailed prompt. This prompt is specifically tailored to address both the linguistic characteristics of Estonian and the unique translation challenges posed by the WinoGrande dataset. Our findings show that model performance on the human translated Estonian dataset is slightly lower than on the original English test set, while performance on machine-translated data is notably worse. Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7231\u6c99\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bed\u7248\u672c\u7684WinoGrande\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5316\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5728\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7231\u6c99\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u7531\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u5316\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7231\u6c99\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bed\u7279\u70b9\u548cWinoGrande\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6311\u6218\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u7231\u6c99\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7565\u4f4e\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u82f1\u6587\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u66f4\u5dee\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5bf9\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Code to be released upon full publication", "summary": "Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time. Finally, FlexiFlow can be successfully transferred to the protein-conditioned ligand generation task, even when the dataset contains only static pockets without accompanying conformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlexiFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u591a\u4e2a\u6784\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728QM9\u548cGEOM Drugs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u76843D\u4ece\u5934\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6216\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5355\u4e00\u6784\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u666f\u89c2\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7279\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u70b9\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u7ec4\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u6784\u8c61\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6240\u9700\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7279\u6027\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlexiFlow\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5206\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u591a\u4e2a\u6784\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728QM9\u548cGEOM Drugs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u914d\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "FlexiFlow\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u5e94\u53d8\u3001\u72ec\u7279\u4e14\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexiFlow\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6784\u8c61\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u914d\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The methodology combines point and probabilistic forecasts across strategic and operational planning levels, leveraging ensembles of LightGBM models with pooled training sets, quantile regression, and a mixed-integer linear programming reconciliation approach. Results highlight that spatiotemporal dependencies, as well as rounding bias, significantly affect forecast accuracy, underscoring the importance of integer forecasts for operational feasibility. Shapley analysis shows that short-term demand is reactive, shaped by life cycle maturity, autoregressive momentum, and operational signals, whereas medium-term demand reflects anticipatory drivers such as online engagement, planning targets, and competitive indicators, with online behavioral data considerably improving accuracy at disaggregated levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u5fb7\u56fd\u9ad8\u7aef\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7684\u591a\u4ea7\u54c1\u3001\u591a\u5e02\u573a\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LightGBM\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u53d6\u6574\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7aef\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u9762\u4e34\u4ea7\u54c1\u79cd\u7c7b\u7e41\u591a\u3001\u53d8\u4f53\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u6ce2\u52a8\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u9884\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u4ea7\u54c1\u3001\u591a\u5e02\u573a\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u6708\u5ea6\u6c7d\u8f66\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6218\u7565\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u89c4\u5212\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5229\u7528LightGBM\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u6c60\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u3001\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u53d6\u6574\u504f\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6574\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u8fd0\u8425\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u77ed\u671f\u9700\u6c42\u53d7\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u3001\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e2d\u671f\u9700\u6c42\u53d7\u5728\u7ebf\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u6307\u6807\u7b49\u9884\u671f\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ebf\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u89e3\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u4e2d\u671f\u9700\u6c42\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block.

SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model). Our experiments span five canonical datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, and demonstrate substantial gains post-training. SAVeD achieves significantly higher accuracy on completely unseen tables in, and a significant boost in separation scores, confirming its capability to distinguish semantically altered versions.

However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u6b65\u957f\u8c03\u5ea6\u548cSGHMC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6392\u65a5\u529b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u6b65\u957f\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0eSGHMC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08MMD\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6392\u65a5\u529b\u6765\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ReBaPL\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ReBaPL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u523b\u753b\u63d0\u793a\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training.

While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u9c81\u68d2\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ffd\u6355\u7b56\u7565\uff08R2PS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ffd\u9003\u535a\u5f08\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u606f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u8003\u8651\u9003\u907f\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u8ffd\u6355\u8005\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u7528\u8ffd\u6355\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u79fb\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u9003\u907f\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06DP\u8ffd\u6355\u7b56\u7565\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u5d4c\u5165EPG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u56fe\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u6297\u5f02\u6b65\u79fb\u52a8DP\u9003\u907f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u535a\u5f08\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "R2PS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ffd\u6355\u7b56\u7565\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via \"masked-then-fill\" and \"step reordering\" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable.

Coreset selection aims to accelerate training by identifying small, representative subsets of data that approximate the performance of the full dataset. Among various approaches, gradient based methods stand out due to their strong theoretical underpinnings and practical benefits, particularly under limited data budgets. However, these methods face challenges such as naive stochastic gradient descent (SGD) acting as a surprisingly strong baseline and the breakdown of representativeness due to loss curvature mismatches over time.\n  In this work, we propose a novel framework that addresses these limitations. First, we establish a connection between posterior sampling and loss landscapes, enabling robust coreset selection even in high data corruption scenarios. Second, we introduce a smoothed loss function based on posterior sampling onto the model weights, enhancing stability and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. We also present a novel convergence analysis for our sampling-based coreset selection method. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our approach achieves faster training and enhanced generalization across diverse datasets than the current state of the art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9884\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u3002\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34SGD\u57fa\u7ebf\u5f3a\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u5931\u6548\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9884\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning. Yet, existing frequent or discriminative subgraph mining approaches often suffer from redundant multi-phase pipelines, high computational cost, and weak coupling between mined structures and their discriminative relevance. We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime.

Submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine", "summary": "Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions. By eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing, our method unlocks the potential for portable, deployable MALDI-MS platforms, revolutionizing environmental pathogen detection and rapid response to biological threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "MS-DGFormer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8d28\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u75c5\u539f\u4f53\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u6b21\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6MALDI-MS\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMALDI-MS\u4f9d\u8d56\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7684\u6837\u54c1\u5236\u5907\u548c\u591a\u8c31\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6MALDI-MS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u4e3b\u91c7\u6837\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u566a\u58f0\u8c31\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5355\u6b21\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMS-DGFormer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8c31\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3(SVD)\u7684\u5b57\u5178\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6765\u96c6\u6210\u53bb\u566a\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u6b21\u8c31\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c14\u6eb6\u80f6\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u75c5\u539f\u4f53\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91ca\u653e\u4e86\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72MALDI-MS\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9769\u65b0\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u75c5\u539f\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5a01\u80c1\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002"}}

In our approach, the agent embodies the user's \"persona\" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge.

To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c03\u8282\u5668(LQR)\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u987a\u5e8f\u6d88\u9664\u548c\u96f6\u9636\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u79bb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\u5927\u5c0f\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u989d\u5916\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c55\u793a\u805a\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u4ece\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7edf\u8ba1\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u53c8\u4e0d\u4f1a\u56e0\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u800c\u906d\u53d7\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u3002"}}
