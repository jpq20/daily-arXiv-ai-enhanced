In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u89e6\u53d1\u901a\u4fe1", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u56e0\u901a\u4fe1\u9650\u5236\u800c\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u534f\u8c03\u4e0d\u826f\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u8003\u8651\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u89e6\u53d1\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u662f\u5426\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

These autonomous agents often operate in trustless environments, where centralized coordination faces significant challenges, such as the inability to ensure transparent contribution measurement and equitable incentive distribution. While blockchain is frequently proposed as a decentralized coordination platform, it inherently introduces high on-chain computation costs and risks exposing sensitive execution information of the agents. Consequently, the core challenge lies in enabling auditable task execution and fair incentive distribution for autonomous LLM agents in trustless environments, while simultaneously preserving their strategic privacy and minimizing on-chain costs. To address this challenge, we propose DAO-Agent, a novel framework that integrates three key technical innovations: (1) an on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance mechanism for transparent coordination and immutable logging; (2) a ZKP mechanism approach that enables Shapley-based contribution measurement off-chain, and (3) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that verifies ZKP-validated contribution measurements on-chain with minimal computational overhead. We implement DAO-Agent and conduct end-to-end experiments using a crypto trading task as a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that DAO-Agent achieves up to 99.9% reduction in verification gas costs compared to naive on-chain alternatives, with constant-time verification complexity that remains stable as coalition size increases, thereby establishing a scalable foundation for agent coordination in decentralized environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAO-Agent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210DAO\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u94fe\u4e0a/\u94fe\u4e0b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u4e3bLLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65e0\u4fe1\u4efb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6fc0\u52b1\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u6218\u7565\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u94fe\u4e0a\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3bLLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e0\u4fe1\u4efb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u900f\u660e\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u5206\u914d\u3002\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u5e73\u53f0\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u94fe\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u66b4\u9732\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u654f\u611f\u6267\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAO-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u94fe\u4e0aDAO\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u65e5\u5fd7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff1b2) \u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\u652f\u6301\u94fe\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8eShapley\u503c\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b3) \u6df7\u5408\u94fe\u4e0a/\u94fe\u4e0b\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5728\u94fe\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1ZKP\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDAO-Agent\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u751f\u94fe\u4e0a\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe99.9%\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1gas\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u4e14\u968f\u8054\u76df\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "DAO-Agent\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3bLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65e0\u4fe1\u4efb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210DAO\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u96f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u6218\u7565\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u94fe\u4e0a\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Such assistants are also termed LLM-driven agents. Upon receiving user requests, the LLM-driven agent generates plans using an LLM, executes these plans through various tools, and then returns the response to the user. During this process, the latency for generating a plan with an LLM can reach tens of seconds, significantly degrading user experience. Real-world dataset analysis shows that about 30% of the requests received by LLM-driven agents are identical or similar, which allows the reuse of previously generated plans to reduce latency. However, it is difficult to accurately define the similarity between the request texts received by the LLM-driven agent through directly evaluating the original request texts. Moreover, the diverse expressions of natural language and the unstructured format of plan texts make implementing plan reuse challenging. To address these issues, we present and implement a plan reuse mechanism for LLM-driven agents called AgentReuse. AgentReuse leverages the similarities and differences among requests' semantics and uses intent classification to evaluate the similarities between requests and enable the reuse of plans. Experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AgentReuse achieves a 93% effective plan reuse rate, an F1 score of 0.9718, and an accuracy of 0.9459 in evaluating request similarities, reducing latency by 93.12% compared with baselines without using the reuse mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentReuse\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u8ba1\u5212\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf", "motivation": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u5212\u65f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u8fbe\u6570\u5341\u79d2\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7ea630%\u8bf7\u6c42\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u5212\u6587\u672c\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\u4f7f\u8ba1\u5212\u91cd\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86AgentReuse\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bf7\u6c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bf7\u6c42\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u5212\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cAgentReuse\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8693%\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8ba1\u5212\u91cd\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u8bf7\u6c42\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a0.9718\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0.9459\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8693.12%\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentReuse\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u91cd\u7528\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u5212\u6587\u672c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u91cd\u7528\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak (\"model gaps\") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves (\"benchmark gaps\"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done.

Code available at https://github.com/wltang-dev/Latent-Strategy-RL-Agent", "summary": "This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.\n  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u89e3\u653e\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u884c\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u57fa\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\u52a8\u4f5c\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u5faa\u73af\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u5916\u90e8\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u53cd\u601d\u9a71\u52a8\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6536\u655b\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u5956\u52b1\u5373\u53ef\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5916\u90e8\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316\u3002"}}

By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue.

Through systematic evaluation across three transformer architectures and rigorous statistical validation on 12,279 authentic social media posts, we demonstrate significant model instability with accuracy drops reaching 23.4% during event-driven periods. Our analysis reveals maximum confidence drops of 13.0% (Bootstrap 95% CI: [9.1%, 16.5%]) with strong correlation to actual performance degradation.

Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u957f\u6587\u6863\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u6863\u65f6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684RAG\u65b9\u6848\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u878d\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684RAG\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u6863\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272"}}

Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings.

A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff09\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u521b\u5efa\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\u662f\u80fd\u591f\u66b4\u9732\u88ab\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff09\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u7ade\u4e89\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u66b4\u9732\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6545\u969c\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5224\u522b\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u4e09\u6b21\u5bf9\u6297\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u6709\u524d\u9014\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.\n  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.\n  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u7ef4\u6301\u5728\u524d3-5\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fatoken\u7684\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7834\u574f\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5b9a\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u540e\u5206\u6790\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u533a\u5206\u673a\u5236\u3002\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6df1\u5ea6\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) 0-1\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u540ctoken\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6df1\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff1b4) \u81ea\u52a8\u533a\u5206\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u578b\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784(Qwen2.5-3B\u5230Qwen2.5-32B)\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523086.2-90.6%\uff1b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u6297\u9057\u5fd8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad83.3-7.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce microprobe, a novel approach that achieves comprehensive reliability assessment using only 100 strategically selected probe examples. Our method combines strategic prompt diversity across five key reliability dimensions with advanced uncertainty quantification and adaptive weighting to efficiently detect potential failure modes. Through extensive empirical evaluation on multiple language models (GPT-2 variants, GPT-2 Medium, GPT-2 Large) and cross-domain validation (healthcare, finance, legal), we demonstrate that microprobe achieves 23.5% higher composite reliability scores compared to random sampling baselines, with exceptional statistical significance (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.21). Expert validation by three AI safety researchers confirms the effectiveness of our strategic selection, rating our approach 4.14/5.0 versus 3.14/5.0 for random selection. microprobe completes reliability assessment with 99.9% statistical power while representing a 90% reduction in assessment cost and maintaining 95% of traditional method coverage.

We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4f46\u8f83\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u8f6c\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u66f4\u793c\u8c8c\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u3001\u65b0\u624b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56de\u5408\u7684\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u56de\u5408\u7ea7\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u3001\u65b0\u624b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56de\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u56de\u5e94\u3002\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u8f6c\u8ff0\u3001\u8981\u6c42\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3001\u793c\u8c8c\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u8f83\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bfc\u5e08\u7279\u6709\u7684\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u8f6c\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u66f4\u793c\u8c8c\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u91cd\u8ff0\u548c\u8f6c\u8ff0\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u8981\u6c42\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u793c\u8c8c\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd1\u671f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u56de\u5e94\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA.

While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure.

Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u76f8\u5bf9\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u59d3\u540d\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u5173\u8054\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u504f\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728Gemma-2-9B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u878d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u804c\u4e1a\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u59d3\u540d\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u504f\u89c1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u5f52\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u5148\u9a8c\u5d29\u6e83\"\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u603b\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u6e90\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately.

This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing. AI entities are modeled as nodes in a dynamic interaction graph, where edges represent time-specific behavioral trajectories.

We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u8bef\u5bfc\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9762\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e5f\u4f1a\u56e0\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b83\u4eec\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u9896\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u6b3a\u9a97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u5b57\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u4e3a\u65b0\u9896\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u7b80\u5355\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u7b26\u53f7\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLMs\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56", "conclusion": "LLMs\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8eLLMs\u7684\u666e\u904d\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7a33\u5065\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e2d"}}

Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) and inverse lithography technique (ILT) remain indispensable but computationally expensive, requiring repeated simulations that limit scalability. Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences.

Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions.

However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7684\"\u4e3b\u5bfc-\u88ab\u4e3b\u5bfc\"\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DominanceBench\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3b\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u6291\u5236\u5176\u4ed6\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u79f0\u4e3aDvD\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6210\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DominanceBench\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76DvD\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5934\u90e8\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u9650\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6807\u8bb0\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u9971\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e76\u5728\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u6291\u5236\u5176\u4ed6\u6807\u8bb0\uff1bDvD\u884c\u4e3a\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u5d29\u6e83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u8fdb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios.

Nevertheless, studies in this context face significant limitations inherent to real-world medical databases: data are often scarce due to both economic costs and the time required for collection; many existing records are not suitable for specific analytical purposes; and, finally, there is a high prevalence of missing values, as not all patients undergo the same diagnostic tests. To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating coherent and realistic synthetic data, whose use improves the accuracy of the various classifiers employed for cardiac risk detection, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CVAE\uff09\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5fc3\u810f\u5eb7\u590d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u810f\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u810f\u5eb7\u590d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u591a\u4e13\u4e1a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5f00\u5c55\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CVAE\uff09\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5371\u9669\u8bca\u65ad\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08\u5982\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d1f\u8377\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u5fc3\u810f\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eCVAE\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5fc3\u810f\u5eb7\u590d\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance.

Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u51b2\u7a81\u5171\u8bc6\u6846\u67b6(DCCF)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u653e\u5927\u800c\u975e\u6291\u5236\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53473.52%", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7a00\u91ca\u4e86\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u9020\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u51b2\u7a81\u5171\u8bc6\u6846\u67b6(DCCF)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bfb\u6c42\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a1)\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\uff1b2)\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fed\u4ee3\u6781\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u5927\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b3)\u51b2\u7a81\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDCCF\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53473.52%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bfb\u6c42\u548c\u653e\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\u800c\u975e\u6291\u5236\u5b83\u4eec\uff0cDCCF\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bfb\u6c42\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While Functional TAI (FTAI) focuses on how to implement trustworthy systems, Normative TAI (NTAI) focuses on regulations that need to be enforced. However, gaps between FTAI and NTAI remain, making it difficult to assess trustworthiness of AI systems. We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems.

Tracing Provenance in LLM Reasoning Distillation", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation. We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u6eaf\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u6559\u5e08\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u56de\u5f52\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u6eaf\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5bf9\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u539f\u59cb\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u7387\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u6559\u5e08\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6e90\u81ea\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u5e76\u80fd\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6eaf\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u5f15\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters.

Published in AI (MDPI), 2026", "summary": "Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance.

Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research.", "AI": {"tldr": "FEND\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u7cbe\u795e\u969c\u788d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u3001\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u548c\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7cbe\u795e\u969c\u788d\uff08\u5982\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u3001\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u3001\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\uff09\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u5f02\u5e38\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFEND\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5229\u752813\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u4e2d\u6587\u3001\u5e0c\u814a\u8bed\u3001\u6cd5\u8bed\u3001\u8377\u5170\u8bed\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u6cdb\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u548c\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u662f\u666e\u904d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6709\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8de8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5f02\u8d28\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "FEND\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7cbe\u795e\u969c\u788d\u8bc4\u4f30\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations.

However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25.

Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them.

Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary \"thinking tokens\" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\"\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\"\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u548cRNA\u7b49\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff08\u5982\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u7b54\u6848\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\"\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\"\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u96c6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\uff0c\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6559\u4f1a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u5c04\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u7269\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Understanding the stability and robustness of these models is crucial for optimizing their training, architecture, and real-world applicability. This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy.

Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($\u03bb$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u6e10\u8fdb\u7ec6\u5316\u62bd\u8c61\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6807\u51c6RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6216\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u5c11\u6570\u5904\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u62bd\u8c61\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5173\u952e\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\u6e10\u8fdb\u7ec6\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u589e\u52a0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7fTD(\u03bb)\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u62bd\u8c61\u5e76\u6e10\u8fdb\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1RL\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\\approx94\\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e8eSFT\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1RLVR\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76RLVR\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6db5\u76d6\u4e24\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u8f74\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a1\uff09\u6982\u7387\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\uff08\u5173\u8054\u6027\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u6027\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff08\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528RLVR\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u5bf9Qwen-2.5-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff083B-32B\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\u3002", "result": "RLVR\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea7\u522b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4SFT\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u8de8\u7ea7\u522b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002RLVR\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u5f53\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u521d\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\uff0cRLVR\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2d\u95f4\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u4ec5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u521d\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u624d\u4f1a\u663e\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RLVR\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats.

This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization.

This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($\u03b3$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $\u03b3$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[\u03b8]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.\n  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a \"quality function\" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.\n  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u7684\u4e9a\u7ec4\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807EPE\u548cCRS\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e868\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u4e9a\u7ec4\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u627e\u5230\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7fCox\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3Cox\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e9a\u7ec4\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u9884\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\uff08EPE\uff09-\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff1b2\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u79e9\u7edf\u8ba1\uff08CRS\uff09-\u91cf\u5316\u4e2a\u4f53\u70b9\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u4e9a\u7ec4\u751f\u5b58\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e868\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528EPE\u548cCRS\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bbe\u5b9a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8bbe\u5b9a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u4e9a\u7ec4\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u62df\u5408Cox\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u3002NASA\u55b7\u6c14\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027/\u540c\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Cox\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e9a\u7ec4\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684EPE\u548cCRS\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e9a\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \\textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \\textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions.

While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrafficSimAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u534f\u4f5c\u7b80\u5316\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u4e5f\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u5982SUMO\u548cMATSim\u529f\u80fd\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6613\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u534f\u4f5c\uff1a\u9ad8\u5c42\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u6309\u9700\u8c03\u7528MCP\u517c\u5bb9\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u4f4e\u5c42\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u72b6\u51b5\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u5143\u7d20\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u884c\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTrafficSimAgent\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6267\u884c\u5404\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5408\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u5176\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cSOTA LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TrafficSimAgent\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\\times$ more data-efficient than standard training.

The core idea of \\texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \\ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \\texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections.

LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u805a\u5408\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7528LLM\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u62df\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884cA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u957f\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u3002LLM\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ec9\u4ef7\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u51c6\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u7279\u5f81\u5316\uff1a\u5f53(1)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u89c2\u5bdf\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c(2)\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u6210\u679c\u800c\u975e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8eab\u4efd\u65f6\uff0c\u7528\u89d2\u8272\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ea\u662f\u9762\u677f\u66f4\u6362\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u805a\u5408\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u89d2\u8272\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cLLM\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u72ec\u7acb\u89d2\u8272\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3aA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5ec9\u4ef7\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Ma"], "title": "Your Reasoning Benchmark May Not Test Reasoning: Revealing Perception Bottleneck in Abstract Reasoning Benchmarks", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.\n  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3aARC\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u800c\u975e\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u9886\u57df\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3aARC\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u8fd9\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a1) \u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u72ec\u7acb\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b2) \u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u9632\u6b62\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u5f52\u7eb3\u4fe1\u53f7\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u74f6\u9888\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5728Mini-ARC\u3001ACRE\u548cBongard-LOGO\u4e09\u4e2aARC\u98ce\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5bf9VLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u67e5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ea680%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ARC\u98ce\u683c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ef\u80fd\u5938\u5927\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\\times$ speedups and $3\\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\\% [95\\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\\% [95\\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\\% [95\\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations.

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality.

We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks.

The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991.", "AI": {"tldr": "GCO-HPIF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u8054\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e3287\u4e2a\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u75285\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u96be\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u65700.9921\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u7c7bF1\u5206\u65700.878\uff0cROC-AUC\u5206\u65700.9083\uff08\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75283\u4e2a\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u5173\u8054\u89c4\u5219\u652f\u6301\u5ea60.8829\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u738787.64%\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u767e\u5206\u6bd4RMSE\u4e3a5.12\uff0cR\u00b2\u503c\u4e3a0.991\u3002", "conclusion": "GCO-HPIF\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "RevFFN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006Transformer\u5757\u91cd\u6784\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355GPU\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u91cf\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u7528\u4e8e\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLMs\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u5982DeepSpeed\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7ZeRO\u548cFSDP\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "RevFFN\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9006Transformer\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u671f\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u6784\u5c42\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d88\u9664\u5b58\u50a8\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86MoE\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "result": "RevFFN\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u6216\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RevFFN\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5355GPU\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8425\u9500\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba2\u9605\u5b9a\u4ef7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6709\u62a4\u680f\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u7ec6\u5206\u4ef7\u683c\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u6d41\u5931\u503e\u5411\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u5165\u3001\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u7559\u5b58\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6536\u5165\u3001\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7559\u5b58\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u5546\u4e1a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u5ba2\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6620\u5c04\u98ce\u9669\u8303\u56f4\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5ba2\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3001\u5229\u6da6\u5e95\u7ebf\u548c\u5141\u8bb8\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u7b49\u4e1a\u52a1\u62a4\u680f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f02\u6784SaaS\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u4ef7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ef7\u683c\u8c03\u6574\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5230\u652f\u4ed8\u610f\u613f\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7ec6\u5206\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ef7\u683c\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u624b\u518c\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4f55\u65f6\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u8f6c\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6708\u7ecf\u5e38\u6027\u6536\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\u9053\u5fb7\u62a4\u680f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5ba2\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

Our proposed approach uses Gaussian process operator learning to construct a flexible functional representation formulated directly on function space, making it independent of a particular equation or discretization. Our method is flexible, and can apply to a broad range of functional differential equations while still allowing for the incorporation of physical priors in either the prior mean or the kernel design. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several relevant equations, such as the Wetterich and Wilson--Polchinski equations, showing that it achieves equal or better performance than existing approximations such as the local-potential approximation, while being significantly more flexible. In particular, our method can handle non-constant fields, making it promising for the study of more complex field configurations, such as instantons.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u6cdb\u51fd\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u6cdb\u51fd\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u7a0b\u6216\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u5c40\u57df\u52bf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u6cdb\u51fd\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u6052\u5b9a\u573a\u65f6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u7c7b\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u79ef\u5206-\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u51fd\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u7a0b\u6216\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u6216\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5165\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Wetterich\u65b9\u7a0b\u548cWilson-Polchinski\u65b9\u7a0b\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7b49\u4e8e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5c40\u57df\u52bf\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u975e\u6052\u5b9a\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u6cdb\u51fd\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u573a\u6784\u578b\uff08\u5982\u77ac\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e09\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u914d\u5bf9\u914d\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u6210\u719f\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "1. \u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e09\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u9884\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u540c\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u7b54\u6848\uff09\u3001\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u95ee\u9898\u62bd\u6837\uff09\u3001\u603b\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u9075\u5faa\u603b\u65b9\u5dee\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff09\n2. \u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u914d\u5bf9\u914d\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5bf9\u6240\u6709LLM\u5bf9\u5e94\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u6d4b\u91cf\u6240\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u91cf\n3. \u5f3a\u8c03\u76f8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548", "result": "1. \u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u603b\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\n2. \u914d\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u5e38\u8d85\u8fc7\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u610f\u5473\u7740\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u9884\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\n3. \u4f7f\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u9700\u5b9a\u5236\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5373\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6548\u5e94", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse samples, yet they risk memorizing training data when overfit to the training objective. We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized \"spiky\" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing \"balanced\" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering.

Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCSD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u745e\u58eb\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u914d\u5bf9\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ade\u4e89\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u745e\u58eb\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\uff08CSD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u987a\u5e8f\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u6839\u636e\u7d2f\u8ba1\u80dc\u8d1f\u8bb0\u5f55\u52a8\u6001\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff08N=100,000\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u671f\u671b\u83b7\u80dc\u5206\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6bcf\u8f6e\u6dd8\u6c70\u6570\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5931\u8d25\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u7a33\u5065\u901a\u624d\u548c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4e13\u624d\u3002", "result": "CSD\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u805a\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u9759\u6001\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5411\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "CSD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u52a8\u6001\u7ade\u4e89\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6392\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP.

The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions. Overall, the unified forecasting framework offers reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, and strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems and provides essential technical support for intelligent backend management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u8026\u5408\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u8026\u5408\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u76d1\u63a7\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u5757\u5efa\u6a21\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u8282\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8868\u793a\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u73af\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u540e\u7aef\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u5355\u5c42Transformer\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ebf\u6027\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4e0e\u5177\u6709\u5b8c\u5584\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cTransformer\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u5728\u8003\u8651\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6216\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0csoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u51f8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u632f\u8361\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5219\u5145\u5f53\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4f55\u65f6\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima. Empirically, SAMerging establishes a new state of the art across vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving remarkable performance.

This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations.

On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks", "comment": null, "summary": "The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8868\u660e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f4e\u5c42\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u524d\u5e38\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u524d\u5904\u7406\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8868\u660e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f18\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4eba\u4eec\u5e38\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u5c42\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u5b9e\u8df5\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f4e\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u6709\u76ca\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bf9\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\u4e14\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6536\u655b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b2. \u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u63a2\u7d22\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u9884\u5904\u7406\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u7406\u8bba\uff1b5. \u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "result": "1. \u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u53d1\u73b0\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u9884\u5904\u7406\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3. \u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5b9e\u9645\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b4. \u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u524d\u7684\u4f4e\u5c42\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u589e\u76ca\u53d7\u5230\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u4e86\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6700\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}
