Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b8c\u5168\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u5b8c\u5168\u6784\u5efa\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u68c0\u67e5\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7ec4\u5728\u56fe\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u6216\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u9650\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u6784\u5efa\u6574\u4e2a\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u578b\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

These workflows generate rapidly expanding contexts that must be curated, transformed, and compressed to maintain fidelity, avoid attention dilution, and reduce inference cost. Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency.

This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u7236\u6bcd\u3001\u6210\u4eba\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fc3\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u63a5\u6216\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u52a8\u673a\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u88ab\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u72b6\u6001\uff1a\u7236\u6bcd\u3001\u6210\u4eba\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u81ea\u6211\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5411\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5fc3\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u4e30\u5bcc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e8e\u5c06\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

This sampling procedure makes the update sparse, reducing both computation and communication costs which in turn improves the scalability of Muon.", "AI": {"tldr": "Dion2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5316Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u884c\u6216\u5217\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500", "motivation": "Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u968f\u7740\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5e26\u6765\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5927\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fdb\u5165\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "Dion2\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u884c\u6216\u5217\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9009\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f7f\u66f4\u65b0\u53d8\u5f97\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Dion2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03LLM\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6355\u6349\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u4fe1\u606f\u5b50\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd4\u56de\u5355\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u67e5\u8be2\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5019\u9009\u5b50\u56fe\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u5e73\u51e1\u6216\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u72ec\u7279\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniRel-R1\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u5b50\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9f13\u52b1\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u5ea6\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniRel-R1\u5728\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4Vanilla\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8865\u5145\uff0cUniRel-R1\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5b50\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u72ec\u7279\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u5173\u8054\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316(MAPPO)\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMAPPO-LCR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5408\u4f5c\u5956\u52b1\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6536\u76ca\u8026\u5408\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6f14\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u5927\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u8026\u5408\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edfPPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAPPO-LCR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8054\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6536\u76ca\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u5408\u4f5c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u5408\u4f5c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u539f\u59cb\u535a\u5f08\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3) \u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMAPPO-LCR\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u6536\u655b\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86MAPPO\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8ePPO\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "MAPPO-LCR\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u8026\u5408\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5408\u4f5c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u7fa4\u4f53\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Struct-SQL\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u793a\uff08\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\uff09\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728Text-to-SQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316CoT\u84b8\u998f\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53478.1%", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7Text-to-SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8feb\u4f7f\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u6539\u8fdb\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStruct-SQL\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u4eff\u5f3a\u5927\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u800c\u975e\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316CoT\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316CoT\u84b8\u998f\u57fa\u7ebf\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4e868.1%\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u662f\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u84dd\u56fe\u6559\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210SQL\u662f\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u3002\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408EEG\u548cEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0\u5047\u80a2\u7684\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u603b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6240\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u5730\u533a\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u80a2\u5047\u80a2\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u622a\u80a2\u8005\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u5730\u533a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b9e\u60e0\u4e14\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2\u91c7\u96c6EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ThinkGear\u84dd\u7259\u4f20\u8f93\u5230ESP32\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7728\u773c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u90e8\u5f00\u5408\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528MyoWare 2.0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u91c7\u96c6EMG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8098\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e26\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u603b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6240\u7f8e\u5143\uff0cEEG\u63a7\u5236\u56db\u4e2a\u624b\u6307\u8235\u673a\uff0cEMG\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u4e2a\u8098\u90e8\u8235\u673a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u751f\u7269\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u5730\u533a\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5065\u5eb7\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5305\u62ec3D\u6253\u5370\u5916\u58f3\u3001\u51cf\u5c11EMG\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8235\u673a\u626d\u77e9\u3002"}}

Progress is limited by weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data. We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u865a\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0e\u8c61\u5f81\u5a01\u80c1\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u76f4\u63a5\u589e\u52a0\u654c\u610f\uff0c\u800c\u8c61\u5f81\u5a01\u80c1\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5f31\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u4e2d\u4ecb\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u654c\u610f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b2\u7a81\u901a\u5e38\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u7269\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u8c61\u5f81\u4ef7\u503c\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u54ea\u4e2a\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u53d7\u5230\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u8584\u5f31\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u865a\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u64cd\u7eb5\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u8c61\u5f81\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u9a8c\u5e95\u5c42LLM\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u4e0d\u540c\u5a01\u80c1\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u64cd\u7eb5\u5982\u4f55\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5e95\u5c42LLM\u5c06\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u3001\u8c61\u5f81\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u654c\u610f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u76f4\u63a5\u589e\u52a0\u654c\u610f\uff0c\u800c\u8c61\u5f81\u5a01\u80c1\u6548\u5e94\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u4e2d\u4ecb\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u654c\u610f\uff1b\u975e\u654c\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u63a5\u89e6\u7f13\u51b2\u51b2\u7a81\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f7f\u654c\u610f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u591a\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u865a\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u6a21\u62df\u4e3a\u5a01\u80c1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5a01\u80c1\u662f\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8c61\u5f81\u5a01\u80c1\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u975e\u654c\u5bf9\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Unlike the well-established autoregressive language modeling paradigm, which has a plethora of standard training and inference libraries, implementations of non-autoregressive language modeling have largely been bespoke making it difficult to perform systematic comparisons of different methods. Moreover, each non-autoregressive language model typically requires it own data collation, loss, and prediction logic, making it challenging to reuse common components. In this work, we present the XLM python package, which is designed to make implementing small non-autoregressive language models faster with a secondary goal of providing a suite of small pre-trained models (through a companion xlm-models package) that can be used by the research community.

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case.

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling.

Evaluation and methodology study on dialogue topic segmentation", "summary": "Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6bb5\u843d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914dF1\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u6458\u8981\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5339\u914d\u548cF1\u6307\u6807\u3002\u968f\u7740LLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u5272\u7ba1\u7406\u8d85\u51fa\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u4e0d\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u4ee3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6bb5\u843d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7a97\u53e3\u5bb9\u5fcdF1\uff08W-F1\uff09\u3002\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u3001\u4f1a\u8bae\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5408\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a1\uff09\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6807\u6ce8\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8fb9\u754c\u6807\u7b7e\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2\uff09\u8bb8\u591a\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f2a\u5f71\u800c\u975e\u8fb9\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b3\uff09\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u9ad8\u6bb5\u843d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u4f4e\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914dF1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u5272\u5e94\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7c92\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u4e00\u6b63\u786e\u8fb9\u754c\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u6bb5\u843d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914dF1\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u3002"}}

Uses publicly available METAR surface observations and TAF forecast data for benchmarking", "summary": "Short-term prediction (nowcasting) of low-visibility and precipitation events is critical for aviation safety and operational efficiency. Current operational approaches rely on computationally intensive numerical weather prediction guidance and human-issued TAF products, which often exhibit conservative biases and limited temporal resolution. This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms.

However, directly applying the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to multi-turn tasks exposes notable limitations, particularly in scenarios requiring long-horizon reasoning. To address these challenges, we investigate more stable and effective advantage estimation strategies, especially for multi-turn settings. We first explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an alternative and find it to be more robust than GRPO. To further enhance PPO in multi-turn scenarios, we introduce turn-PPO, a variant that operates on a turn-level MDP formulation, as opposed to the commonly used token-level MDP.

We propose a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates.

However, existing MMRAG methods fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, which limits the explainability of the results. To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation. Specifically, in the first stage, rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning is employed to perform coarse-grained point-wise ranking of multi-modal documents, effectively filtering out those that are significantly irrelevant. In the second stage, reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning is utilized to jointly optimize fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation, guiding multi-modal large language models to output explainable reasoning logic in the MMRAG process.

This global view helps organize prior knowledge, interpret new information, and integrate evidence dispersed across a document, as revealed by the Mindscape-Aware Capability of humans in psychology. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack such guidance and therefore struggle with long-context tasks. In this paper, we propose Mindscape-Aware RAG (MiA-RAG), the first approach that equips LLM-based RAG systems with explicit global context awareness. MiA-RAG builds a mindscape through hierarchical summarization and conditions both retrieval and generation on this global semantic representation. This enables the retriever to form enriched query embeddings and the generator to reason over retrieved evidence within a coherent global context. We evaluate MiA-RAG across diverse long-context and bilingual benchmarks for evidence-based understanding and global sense-making.

In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable.

However, evaluations of unified multimodal models (UMMs) remain decoupled, assessing their understanding and generation abilities separately with corresponding datasets. To address this, we propose UmniBench, a benchmark tailored for UMMs with omni-dimensional evaluation. First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models.

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own. This confirms the effectiveness of combining multiple hypotheses with noise-aware embeddings for robust Persian ASR in noisy real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2ASR\u7ea0\u9519\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u878d\u5408\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c06\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4ece31.10%\u964d\u4f4e\u523024.84%\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5c24\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662fWhisper\u7b49\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u7684ASR\u7ea0\u9519\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u62105\u4e2a\u6700\u4f73\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea7\u522b\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5047\u8bbe\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5931\u771f\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u57fa\u7840LLaMA-2-7B\u3001\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u5047\u8bbe\u5fae\u8c03\u53d8\u4f53\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u96c6\u6210ELN\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5fae\u8c03+ELN\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4ece\u539f\u59cbWhisper\u768431.10%\u964d\u4f4e\u523024.84%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u768430.79%\u3002\u539f\u59cbLLaMA-2-7B\u6a21\u578b\u5c06WER\u589e\u52a0\u523064.58%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u7ea0\u6b63\u6ce2\u65af\u8bed\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6ce2\u65af\u8bedASR\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0cELN\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u7684\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002"}}

To appear in Hudl Performance Insights 2025", "summary": "Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "EventGPT\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7403\u5458\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8db3\u7403\u8f6c\u4f1a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6c\u4f1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7403\u5458\u5728\u65b0\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u961f\u53cb\u914d\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u98ce\u683c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u7403\u5458\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6bd4\u8d5b\u5904\u7406\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u6301\u7403\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6301\u7403\u4ef7\u503c(rOBV)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u6362\u7403\u5458\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df", "result": "\u5728\u82f1\u8d85\u4e94\u4e2a\u8d5b\u5b63\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cEventGPT\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8f6c\u4f1a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528", "conclusion": "EventGPT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u4f1a\u9002\u914d\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u7403\u5458\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7403\u961f\u6216\u6218\u672f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u4f1a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u4f9d\u636e"}}

Offloading alleviates GPU memory by fetching experts on demand, yet token-level routing causes irregular transfers that make inference I/O-bound.

We present Bandwidth-Efficient Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts via Low-Rank Compensation, which performs router-guided precision restoration using precomputed low-rank compensators. At inference time, our method transfers compact low-rank factors with Top-n (n<k) experts per token and applies compensation to them, keeping others low-bit. Integrated with offloading on GPU and GPU-NDP systems, our method delivers a superior bandwidth-accuracy trade-off and improved throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBEAMoE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u8865\u507f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e26\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684I/O\u5e26\u5bbd\u9700\u6c42", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6269\u5c55\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed9\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u5e26\u6765\u538b\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86GPU\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46token\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u53d7\u9650\u4e8eI/O\u3002\u9759\u6001\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u6d41\u91cf\u4f46\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6fc0\u8fdb\u538b\u7f29\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e26\u5bbd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u8865\u507f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u8865\u507f\u5668\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u8f93\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u56e0\u5b50\u7ed9\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684Top-n\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u8865\u507f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eGPU\u548cGPU-NDP\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002\u5728GPU\u548cGPU-NDP\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\u5378\u8f7d\u540e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684BEAMoE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86I/O\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best. These findings demonstrate that exposure to flawed traces during training can improve error-recovery behavior without sacrificing accuracy, suggesting a path toward more robust mathematical reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6545\u610f\u5305\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6807\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u5f88\u8106\u5f31\uff1a\u5355\u4e2a\u7b97\u672f\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u63a8\u65ad\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u60f3\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MATH-lighteval\u7ade\u8d5b\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u5355\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u5bf9Qwen3-4B\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "Mixed-CoT-RL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6RL\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0841% vs 41%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5305\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6RL\uff0824% vs 19%\uff09\u3002\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684RL\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0819% vs 20%\uff09\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5305\u542b\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u6548\u679c\u6700\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u66b4\u9732\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6062\u590d\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\"\u6982\u5ff5\"\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6574\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff08\u5982\u51a5\u738b\u661f\u4e0d\u518d\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b57\u5178\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u4fee\u8ba2\u3001\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u53ef\u8de8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u8fa9\u8bc1\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8ba9\u7ade\u4e89\u6982\u5ff5\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u77ed\u6761\u4ef6\u63cf\u8ff0\u89e3\u91ca\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6982\u5ff5\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e3b\u5f20\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6f14\u5316\uff08\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6536\u7f29\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u3001\u5408\u5e76\uff09\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840/\u79cd\u5b50\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u76f8\u540c\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4fee\u8ba2\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u3002"}}

The core algorithm combines gradient-aligned low-rank updates with structured orthogonal transformations through layer-wise mixing and introduces unitary constraints in selected sub-layers to stabilize deep optimization. In tandem with lightweight, label-free data governance steps, including language identification, near-duplicate removal, and quality filtering, the framework targets accuracy, calibration, and cross-language parity under tight compute budgets. Across XNLI and FLORES, the hybrid approach delivers consistent gains over strong PEFT baselines while maintaining directional balance and improving probability calibration, as shown in Tables II and III. It is more resilient to lightweight orthographic variants, as shown in Table IV, and benefits additively from simple governance steps, as shown in Table V. Training footprint measurements indicate modest overhead and a favorable cost-quality frontier, as shown in Table VI and Figure 2. Together, these results show that hybrid and unitary PEFT provide a stable and accessible path to resource-efficient multilingual adaptation when paired with practical data governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u6838\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u5f15\u5165\u9009\u5b9a\u5b50\u5c42\u7684\u9149\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u914d\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff08\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u8fd1\u91cd\u590d\u53bb\u9664\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728XNLI\u548cFLORES\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3aPEFT\u57fa\u7ebf\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u5411\u5e73\u8861\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u6982\u7387\u6821\u51c6\uff1b\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6b63\u5b57\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7b80\u5355\u6cbb\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e26\u6765\u7d2f\u52a0\u6027\u6536\u76ca\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8db3\u8ff9\u6d4b\u91cf\u663e\u793a\u9002\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6709\u5229\u7684\u6210\u672c-\u8d28\u91cf\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u9149PEFT\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6cbb\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u4ece\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u884c\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u96c6\u5408\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u591a\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6982\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eRashomon\u6548\u5e94\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u3002\u4eceRashomon\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u5355\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ece\u8be5\u96c6\u5408\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u5bbd\u677e\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u90fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Our formulation tightly and elegantly couples the two planning paradigms. It leverages reinforcement learning actions to inform the MPPI sampler, and adaptively aggregates MPPI samples to inform the value estimation. The resulting adaptive process leverages further MPPI exploration where value estimates are uncertain, and improves training robustness and the overall resulting policies. This results in a robust planning approach that can handle complex planning problems and easily adapts to different applications, as demonstrated over several domains, including race driving, modified Acrobot, and Lunar Lander with added obstacles. Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548cMPC\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548cMPC\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027", "method": "\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eMPPI\u89c4\u5212\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528RL\u52a8\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfcMPPI\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u5408MPPI\u6837\u672c\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b", "result": "\u5728\u8d5b\u8f66\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Acrobot\u548c\u6dfb\u52a0\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684Lunar Lander\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad872%\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.1\u500d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02"}}

These problems often lead to delays in treatment and poor health outcomes. Most current AI and deep learning diagnostic systems are not very interactive or transparent, making them less effective in real-world, patient-centered environments. This research introduces a diagnostic chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), using GPT-4o, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and explainable AI techniques. The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%. These findings offer a promising outlook for more transparent, interactive, and clinically relevant AI in healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4o\uff09\u7684\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63d0\u53d6\u75c7\u72b6\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u8bca\u65ad\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cbb\u7597\u5ef6\u8bef\u548c\u4e0d\u826f\u5065\u5eb7\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u73b0\u6709AI\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4o\uff09\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5339\u914d\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u95ee\u4f18\u5148\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6734\u7d20\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001SVM\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cKNN\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8fbe\u523090%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c100%\u7684Top-3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7684AI\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To overcome this, we introduce controlled synthetic pretraining tasks that isolate and evaluate core model capabilities. Within this framework, we discover CANON LAYERS: lightweight architectural components -- named after the musical term \"canon\" -- that promote horizontal information flow across neighboring tokens. Canon layers compute weighted sums of nearby token representations and integrate seamlessly into Transformers, linear attention, state-space models, or any sequence architecture.\n  We present 12 key results. This includes how Canon layers enhance reasoning depth (e.g., by $2\\times$), reasoning breadth, knowledge manipulation, etc. They lift weak architectures like NoPE to match RoPE, and linear attention to rival SOTA linear models like Mamba2/GDN -- validated both through synthetic tasks and real-world academic-scale pretraining. This synthetic playground offers an economical, principled path to isolate core model capabilities often obscured at academic scales.

However, their black-box nature limits trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples.

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9a\u65f6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\uff08TRMs\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u8fbe\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u5956\u52b1\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\uff08TRMs\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u683cQ\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u5c06TRM\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5229\u7528TRM\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60f3\u8c61\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u7684RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3TRM\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cTRM\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60f3\u8c61\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9a\u65f6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u89c4\u8303\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources.

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design.

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

Unlike conventional ensembles that often rely on homogeneous architectures, our approach combines architecturally diverse small transformer-based large language models (sLLMs) - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, and ELECTRA, each fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728DAIR-AI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8693.5%\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5927\u578bLLMs\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u8d28\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u53d7\u5b54\u591a\u585e\u966a\u5ba1\u56e2\u5b9a\u7406\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5c0f\u578bLLMs\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bef\u5dee\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "1. \u7ed3\u5408\u4e94\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff1aBERT\u3001RoBERTa\u3001DistilBERT\u3001DeBERTa\u548cELECTRA\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u9488\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b2. \u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u6536\u655b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8bef\u5dee\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u9a8c\u8bc1F1\u5206\u6570\uff09\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\uff09\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR-AI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8693.5%\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5305\u62ecFalcon\u3001Mistral\u3001Qwen\u548cPhi\u5728\u5185\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u540e\u4e5f\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5927\u578bLLMs\u3002\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u4ec5595M\uff0c\u6bd4\u9ad8\u8fbe7B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1aNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u7684LLMs\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

Current workflows compute curvature information during training, discard it, then recompute similar information for merging -- wasting computation and discarding valuable trajectory data. We introduce a unified framework that maintains factorized momentum and curvature statistics during training, then reuses this information for geometry-aware model composition. The proposed method achieves memory efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while accumulating task saliency scores that enable curvature-aware merging without post-hoc Fisher computation. We establish convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives with approximation error bounded by gradient singular value decay. On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature-aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude-only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving over strong baselines. The proposed framework exhibits rank-invariant convergence and superior hyperparameter robustness compared to existing low-rank optimizers. By treating the optimization trajectory as a reusable asset rather than discarding it, our approach eliminates redundant computation while enabling more principled model composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u540e\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u4e22\u5f03\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u9a8cFisher\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u66f2\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5408\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u79e9\u4e0d\u53d8\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u8d44\u4ea7\u800c\u975e\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u3002"}}

While this means that personality frameworks would be highly valuable tools to characterize and control LLMs' behavior, current approaches remain either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering). Probing and steering via linear directions has recently emerged as a cheap and efficient alternative. In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u5728\u4eba\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u53d7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4eba\u683c\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u63a7\u5236LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff08\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8106\u5f31\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff09\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5ec9\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Llama 3.3 70B\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210406\u4e2a\u865a\u6784\u89d2\u8272\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ca\u5176\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5206\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u548cAlpaca\u95ee\u5377\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u968f\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5b66\u4e60\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6bcf\u5c42\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u8d28\u5206\u6570\u5728\u4eba\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1a\u5728\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u9760\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u989d\u5916\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u6d4bLLM\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6216\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86CheXagent\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u5584\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982CLIP\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30Stanford AIMI CheXagent\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u542b\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u542b\u5426\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7token\u5f52\u56e0\u3001t-SNE\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u540eCLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u6b63\u9762\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u8a00\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u533b\u5b66AI\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a contextual biasing method for attention based encoder decoder (AED) models using a list of candidate named entities. Instead of predicting only the next token, we simultaneously predict multiple future tokens, enabling the model to \"peek into the future\" and score potential candidate entities in the entity list.

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026Nesterov\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bcf\u6b65\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u5668DiLoCo\u548cSchedule-Free\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u5de5\u4f5c\u5668DiLoCo\u548cSchedule-Free\u7b49\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ecDiLoCo\u7684\u4e24\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u52a0\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caSchedule-Free\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5e73\u5747\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u539f\u59cb\u5e73\u5747(GPA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026Nesterov\u539f\u59cb\u5e73\u5747\u516c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bcf\u6b65\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e73\u5747\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e24\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u81f3\u5355\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama-160M\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cGPA\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf(AdamW)\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u8fbe\u5230\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534724.22%\uff1b\u5728ImageNet ViT\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u548c\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f9712%\u548c27%\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eGPA\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u539f\u59cb\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "GPA\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u63d2\u503c\u5e38\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

This makes evaluating UGC translation particularly challenging: what counts as a \"good\" translation depends on the level of standardness desired in the output. To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines.

The rapid development of large language models needs benchmarks that can evaluate their comprehension of ancient characters. Existing Chinese benchmarks are mostly targeted at modern Chinese and transmitted documents in ancient Chinese, but the part of excavated documents in ancient Chinese is not covered. To meet this need, we propose the AncientBench, which aims to evaluate the comprehension of ancient characters, especially in the scenario of excavated documents. The AncientBench is divided into four dimensions, which correspond to the four competencies of ancient character comprehension: glyph comprehension, pronunciation comprehension, meaning comprehension, and contextual comprehension. The benchmark also contains ten tasks, including radical, phonetic radical, homophone, cloze, translation, and more, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluation. We convened archaeological researchers to conduct experimental evaluations, proposed an ancient model as baseline, and conducted extensive experiments on the currently best-performing large language models. The experimental results reveal the great potential of large language models in ancient textual scenarios as well as the gap with humans.

For Bangla medical entity recognition, this study first examined a number of transformer models, including BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa. We also propose a novel Multi-BERT Ensemble approach that outperformed all baseline models with the highest accuracy of 89.58%. Notably, it provides an 11.80% accuracy improvement over the single-layer BERT model, demonstrating its effectiveness for this task. A major challenge in MedER for low-resource languages is the lack of annotated datasets. To address this issue, we developed a high-quality dataset tailored for the Bangla MedER task.

As a result, predicting EV charging demand has become a timely and important research problem. While substantial research has addressed energy load forecasting in transportation, relatively few studies systematically compare multiple forecasting methods across different temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels in diverse urban settings. This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods. Forecasting performance is evaluated for short-, mid-, and long-term horizons (on the order of minutes, hours, and days, respectively), and across spatial scales ranging from individual charging stations to regional and city-level aggregations.

Existing benchmarks often lack systematic criteria for expert reporting, evaluations that rely heavily on LLM judges can fail to capture issues that require expert judgment, and source verification typically covers only a limited subset of explicitly cited statements rather than report-wide factual reliability. We introduce DEER, a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports. DEER comprises 50 report-writing tasks spanning 13 domains and an expert-grounded evaluation taxonomy (7 dimensions, 25 sub-dimension) operationalized into 130 fine-grained rubric items. DEER further provides task-specific expert guidance to help LLM judges assess expert-level report quality more consistently. Complementing rubric-based assessment, we propose a document-level fact-checking architecture that extracts and verifies all claims across the entire report, including both cited and uncited ones, and quantifies external-evidence quality.

However, real-world QoS data are extremely sparse, noisy, and shaped by hierarchical dependencies arising from QoS interactions, and geographical and network-level factors, making accurate QoS prediction challenging. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components. First, we introduce a dual mechanism to extract the hierarchical features from both QoS and contextual structures via hyperbolic convolution formulated in the Poincar\u00e9 ball. Second, we propose an adaptive feature-sharing mechanism that allows feature exchange across informative QoS and contextual signals. A gated feature fusion module is employed to support dynamic feature selection among structural and shared representations.

ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances often lost in standard logs, including reasoning traces, source links, and code artifacts, while spanning 101 languages over the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. We demonstrate the dataset's multifaceted utility through three representative analyses: (1) analyzing conversation completeness to measure user intent satisfaction; (2) evaluating source citation behaviors in content generation; and (3) conducting temporal analysis to track evolving usage patterns.

This degradation can be attributed to distribution shifts, including user, character, and dialogue compositional shifts. Existing methods like LLM-as-a-judge fall short in providing a fine-grained diagnosis of how these shifts affect RPM generalization, and thus there lack formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization behaviors. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cfR-EMID\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982LLM-as-a-judge\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8868\u5f81RPM\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cfR-EMID\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u6548\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u6765\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6d4b\u91cfRPM\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff1b2. \u63a8\u5bfcR-EMID\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u6765\u9884\u6d4bRPM\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5404\u79cdRPM\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u504f\u79fb\u5728\u6240\u6709\u504f\u79fb\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u589e\u5f3aRPM\u6cdb\u5316\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002R-EMID\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684R-EMID\u5ea6\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aRPM\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators.", "AI": {"tldr": "MINPO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u7531\u957f\u7a0b\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c/\u6216\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u9006\u5e76\u91cd\u6784\u89e3\u573a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5404\u79cd\u79ef\u5206-\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7531\u79ef\u5206-\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7a7a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5377\u79ef\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u968f\u6838\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u7279\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "MINPO\u4f7f\u7528KANs\u6216MLPs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u9006\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u6784\u672a\u77e5\u89e3\u573a\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u9879\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0e\u91cd\u6784\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6280\u672f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eMLPs\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u7b56\u7565\uff08A-PINN\u3001fPINN\uff09\u53ca\u5176KAN\u53d8\u4f53\uff08A-PIKAN\u3001fPIKAN\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMINPO\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5904\u7406\uff08i\uff09\u591a\u79cd\u6838\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\uff08ii\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u6838\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\uff08iii\uff09\u91cd\u590d\u6838\u79ef\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MINPO\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d7\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u6355\u83b7\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8c31\u7cfb\u7684IDEs\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6570\u9636PDEs\uff09\u652f\u914d\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability.

Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:\n  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms\n  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)\n  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba\n  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fee\u8865\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u56fe\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5305\u62ecMamba\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u673a\u5236\uff08\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5f0f\u6216\u7eaf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fee\u8865\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u57289\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6765\u81ea7\u4e2aTransformer\u5bb6\u65cf\u52a0\u4e0aMamba\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21370M-13B\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u665a\u671fMLP\u4fee\u8865\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f100%\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4fee\u8865\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed1\u5b9a62%\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u3002", "result": "1. \u53cc\u91cd\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u665a\u671fMLP\u4fee\u8865100%\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4fee\u886562%\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\n2. \u5148\u9a8c-\u56fe\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u56fe\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001\uff09\n3. \u67b6\u6784\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff1a\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u975eTransformer\u7684Mamba\uff09\u4e2d\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\n4. \u74f6\u9888\u662f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u51fa\uff1a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e72\u6270\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bef\u8def\u7531\uff0872.7%\u8fd1\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\uff080%\uff09", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e72\u6270\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\uff1a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56fe\u5f0f\u8f6c\u79fb\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5148\u9a8c\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u9ad8\u5148\u9a8c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b38%\u7684\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u3002"}}

However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11ST-GNN\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165SEPA\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "ST-GNN\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u76f8\u90bb\u8fb9\u7f18\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u91cd\u590d\u4f20\u8f93\u91cd\u53e0\u7279\u5f81\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5197\u4f59\u90bb\u5c45\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8c03\u6574\u526a\u679d\u7387\uff1b\u5f15\u5165SEPA\u6307\u6807\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ea4\u901a\u51cf\u901f\u548c\u6062\u590d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u534a\u5206\u6563\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfFL\u3001\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668FL\u548cGossip Learning\u5bf9\u6bd4", "result": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u534a\u5206\u6563\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1bSEPA\u6307\u6807\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u4ef7\u503c", "conclusion": "\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd"}}

We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks.

In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u957f\u671f\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8131\u78b3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u610f\u5927\u5229\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u78b3\u4e2d\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u62cd\u5356\u3001\u652f\u6301\u8ba1\u5212\u7b49\u653f\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\uff09\u5bf9\u5851\u9020\u53d1\u7535\u7ed3\u6784\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5148\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u957f\u671f\u5e02\u573a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5229\u6da6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u53d1\u7535\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u6279\u53d1\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u641c\u7d22\u786e\u4fdd\u5206\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea7\u751f\u7b26\u5408\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u610f\u5927\u5229\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b80\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u7ade\u4e89\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u60c5\u666f\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5e02\u573a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u7535\u529b\u90e8\u95e8\u8131\u78b3\u548c\u907f\u514d\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\u540c\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u8131\u78b3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content.

We introduce SafeBench-Seq, a metadata-only, reproducible benchmark and baseline classifier built entirely from public data (SafeProtein hazards and UniProt benigns) and interpretable features (global physicochemical descriptors and amino-acid composition). To approximate \"never-before-seen\" threats, we homology-cluster the combined dataset at <=40% identity and perform cluster-level holdouts (no cluster overlap between train/test). We report discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and screening-operating points (TPR@1% FPR; FPR@95% TPR) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (n=200), and we provide calibrated probabilities via CalibratedClassifierCV (isotonic for Logistic Regression / Random Forest; Platt sigmoid for Linear SVM). We quantify probability quality using Brier score, Expected Calibration Error (ECE; 15 bins), and reliability diagrams.

Empirically, random splits substantially overestimate robustness relative to homology-clustered evaluation; calibrated linear models exhibit comparatively good calibration, while tree ensembles retain slightly higher Brier/ECE.

Performing such analyses in a statistically rigorous manner is non-trivial, however. Appropriate performance metrics must be selected that allow for valid comparisons between groups of different sample sizes and base rates; metric uncertainty must be determined and multiple comparisons be corrected for, in order to assess whether any observed differences may be purely due to chance; and in the case of intersectional analyses, mechanisms must be implemented to find the most `interesting' subgroups within combinatorially many subgroup combinations. We here present a statistical toolbox that addresses these challenges and enables practitioners to easily yet rigorously assess their models for potential subgroup performance disparities.

Building on gradient accumulation with micro-batches, this paper introduces GreedySnake, a new SSD-offloaded training system that employs vertical scheduling, which executes all microbatches of a layer before proceeding to the next. Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B.

However, the dominant two-stage pipeline (SFT then RL) suffers from a key inconsistency: SFT enforces rigid imitation that suppresses exploration and induces forgetting, limiting RL's potential for improvements. We address this inefficiency with TRAPO (\\textbf{T}rust-\\textbf{R}egion \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization), a hybrid framework that interleaves SFT and RL within each training instance by optimizing SFT loss on expert prefixes and RL loss on the model's own completions, unifying external supervision and self-exploration. To stabilize training, we introduce Trust-Region SFT (TrSFT), which minimizes forward KL divergence inside a trust region but attenuates optimization outside, effectively shifting toward reverse KL and yielding stable, mode-seeking updates favorable for RL. An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility.

However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that sparse, end-to-end, multi-task gene subset selection improves predictive performance and yields compact and meaningful gene subsets, advancing biomarker discovery and single-cell analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "YOTO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u57fa\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u79bb\u6563\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8b\u540e\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u5f31\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faYOTO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u8bc6\u522b\u79bb\u6563\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u53ea\u6709\u9009\u5b9a\u57fa\u56e0\u53c2\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5355\u7ec6\u80deRNA-seq\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cYOTO\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility.

In particular, our methods aim to take into account that often only a handful of the constraints may be binding at the optimum, and hence we should evaluate only relevant constraints when trying to optimise a function. We empirically benchmark these methods against existing methods and demonstrate their superiority over the state-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u8026\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u975e\u5168\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5904\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u662f\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd9\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u91c7\u96c6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u89e3\u8026\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u54ea\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5904\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u975e\u5168\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u6602\u8d35\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.\n  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein-Fisher-Rao\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u51f8/\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u51f8\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u901f\u7387\u4f1a\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6076\u5316\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u6709\u6307\u6570\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u5bf9\u6570\u51f9\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Feynman-Kac\u8868\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eWFR\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u975e\u51f8/\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u6837\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5782\u76f4\uff08\u53cd\u5e94\uff09\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u975e\u51f8\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aWFR-based\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u4f46\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Submitted to ICRA 2026", "summary": "Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRPL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5956\u52b1-\u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u77db\u76fe\uff0cSRPL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Waymo Open Motion Dataset\u548cNuPlan\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30SRPL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5956\u52b1-\u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\u3001\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "SRPL\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5956\u52b1-\u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u91cfr=0.65-0.86\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u679c\u91cfr=0.70-0.83\uff08p<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2dSRPL\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u793a\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u914d\u3002"}}

However, this performance is often dependent on the presence of large and varied datasets. In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.\n  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7f1d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u540c\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u65bd\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u5404\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u7f1d\u5408\u5c42\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u6dfb\u52a0\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u6765\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u4f46\u727a\u7272\u5404\u65b9\u81ea\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7f1d\u5408\u5c42\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u5404\u65b9\u81ea\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7f1d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We establish convergence guarantees for FedSARSA in the presence of heterogeneity, both in local transitions and rewards, providing the first sample and communication complexity bounds in this setting. At the core of our analysis is a new, exact multi-step error expansion for single-agent SARSA, which is of independent interest.

Our approach estimates the model's confidence in each parameter and constrains updates in high-curvature directions, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient target-domain learning. By applying the Laplace approximation only to the LoRA weights, the method remains lightweight. We evaluate LaLoRA by fine-tuning a Llama model for mathematical reasoning and demonstrate an improved learning-forgetting trade-off, which can be directly controlled via the method's regularization strength.

In this work, we propose a plug-and-play calibratable disambiguation loss (CDL) that simultaneously improves classification accuracy and calibration performance. The loss has two instantiations: the first one calibrates predictions based on probabilities from the candidate label set, while the second one integrates probabilities from both candidate and non-candidate label sets. The proposed CDL can be seamlessly incorporated into existing MIPL and PLL frameworks. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes the lower bound and regularization properties of CDL, demonstrating its superiority over conventional disambiguation losses.

To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy. Despite this method's simplicity, we show it outperforms several competitive SR baselines, implying that both ID and text features are necessary to achieve state-of-the-art SR performance but complex fusion architectures are not.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0ID\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5373\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9ID\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b8c\u5168\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u66ff\u4ee3ID\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5219\u91c7\u7528\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5bf9\u9f50\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u8005\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u7814\u7a76ID\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fdd\u6301ID-\u6587\u672c\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eID\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\uff0cID\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u90fd\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5c31\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002"}}

Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \\log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81(RRFF)\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u6620\u5c04(RRFF-FEM)\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u751ft\u5206\u5e03\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9891\u7387\u52a0\u6743Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u6838\u57fa\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u8f83\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRRFF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5143\u5b66\u751ft\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u7387\u52a0\u6743Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u5f53\u7279\u5f81\u6570N\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6570m\u6ee1\u8db3N\u221dm log m\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51faRRFF-FEM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\u6781\u7aef\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2aPDE\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5bf9\u6d41\u3001Burgers\u3001\u8fbe\u897f\u6d41\u3001Helmholtz\u3001Navier-Stokes\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u529b\u5b66\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRRFF\u548cRRFF-FEM\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e0e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RRFF\u548cRRFF-FEM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4ece\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21PDE\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
